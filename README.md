# Barbarkill
## A CLI Turn-based (kind of) game in your terminal to play written in Python
- Release Date = 12.07.2021
- Version = 1.0.0

It's a text-based, turn-based CLI game to spend your time without getting bored while updating your system or your own softwares in your terminal. Today's people sure do hate uncivilized, violent barbarians that terrorize everyone that crosses their path. That's where you come in. Yes, you! We need to get rid of these memory-allocated barbarians from our system in order to maintain our system working. (Literally that's what we're doing)

## What does this game feature?
Since this is my very first game and it's not like an AAA tier game or something, still there are few features I'd like to mention
- Game modes
- Level system
- Dodge system
- Turn system (kind of)
- Bosses

That's it to be honest.

### Here's a screenshot of the menu

### Game modes

There are two game modes currently available to play
- Classic Mode
- Survival Mode

**Classic Mode** : Generates barbarians depending on the difficulty player chose(Also affects the number of generating them). When you slay all of them you'll win unless it's other way around.

**Survival Mode** : It generates only one barbarian and continue to do so till you die. It'll be broken through progressing. If you become really powerful nobody will be powerful enough to kill you. That's exactly why I added an "Exit" action if you get bored. I'd recommend playing on Normal and later difficulties

**Boss Run Mode** : I hadn't thought of anything about that yet.

### Dodge System

It's quite annoying and hard-coded. In the near future maybe I'll try to add Perks system and change the structure completely.

### Character Info

You can view your current character's information. This includes:
- Name
- Strength
- Level and XP bar
- HP and HP percentage bar

### Enemy List

Viewing how many enemies are left to kill and which of them are bosses

### Post-game screen

After the game ends you can view how many different enemies you've killed and how many turns have passed.

## What's next?
I'm currently dropping this project. I'll be focusing on other projects. I just wanted to release my first-ever project made by love and dedication.
If I ever were to come back to continue there are few things I'd like to do, such as:
- Perk System (Rewarding the player with special abilities, %50 chance to dodge etc.)
- Optimizing the math formulas for less hard-coded
- Optimizing the structure of the game
- Adding game modes
- Multiple characters to create and play (like a pokemon game)

Feel free to fork (would be appreciated if you credit) or feedback for any bugs you've encountered. And lastly, thanks for playing my game.
